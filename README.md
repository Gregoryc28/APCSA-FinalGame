## Verbal Memory

Verbal Memory is a game where one word is displayed a time.
The user must click whether the word is new and has not been seen yet, or click seen, which indicates the word has been seen before.
The objective of the game is to get as many words correct as possible. (i.e. more words where you correctly click "new" or "seen")
